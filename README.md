# Movies Extract, Transform, Load

The purpose of this challenge was to practice collecting data, transforming it to suit the need of my project (which was to determine the likelihood of newly released movies being a popular choice to add to an online streaming service) and load it into tables in SQL. The code was refactored from three separate files and then cleaned and transformed using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook before the data was uploaded to a PostgreSQL database.
